## About
In the world of professional basketball, only a select few athletes achieve the highest honor â€“ induction into the NBA Hall of Fame. As fans, analysts, and enthusiasts, we are captivated by the incredible talent and awe-inspiring performances of the current generation of players. However, the burning question remains: Which of these current or latest players will etch their names among the legends in the hallowed halls of basketball greatness?

In this project, we embark on a thrilling journey of prediction and analysis, seeking to uncover the potential future NBA Hall of Famers among the present-day stars. Through a comprehensive collection of data on former players' stats we explore the intricate patterns and distinguishing factors that separate the Hall of Famers from the rest.

In this notebook, we will be using three main sources of NBA player data. Two are datasets are gathered from Kaggle.com, and one source will be a data table scraped from basketball-reference.com. We import and scrape these datasets, then perform data cleaning/parsing techniques on them. These datasets are stored in the Pandas DataFrame format, which allows us to perform a variety of tasks on them, incudling analyzing and visualizing data. We then end by using a few Machine Learning models that will predict if an active NBA player will be a future Hall of Famer based on the averages so far in their career.
